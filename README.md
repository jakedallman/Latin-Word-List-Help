This app allows users to copy and paste a list of Latin words with their definitions. Put in a certain format, 
the app will parse said code and create flashcards for the user to cyle through. The user can mark whether or
not they know a word. All words that the user marked that they didn't know are regurgitated by the program at
the end so that the user can study them.
